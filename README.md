# Mini OS Resource Manager

A console-based simulation of core operating system resource management
techniques implemented using C++.

## Overview
This project simulates how an operating system manages critical resources
such as CPU, memory, and processes. It provides hands-on implementation of
classic OS algorithms widely used in real-world systems.

## Features
- CPU Scheduling using FCFS algorithm
- Memory Management using First Fit allocation strategy
- Deadlock Detection using Banker's Algorithm
- Menu-driven console interface

## Tech Stack
- C++
- Operating System Algorithms

## Modules Implemented
1. CPU Scheduling
   - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2. Memory Management
   - First Fit Allocation
3. Deadlock Detection
   - Banker's Algorithm
